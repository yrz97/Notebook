## Regulation of sister chromatid cohesion during the mitotic cell cycle

### Introduction
*[separase]: it becomes active when its inhibitory chaperone securin and cyclin B1 are degraded at the metaphase–anaphase transition*
The different stages of cohesion require interactions with different regulators.

- **telophase/G1(loading)**:
Cohesin is loaded onto DNA by the cohesin loader complex Scc2–Scc4 and turns over rapidly on chromatin in a Wapl–Pds5-dependent manner.

- **S phase(establishment)**:
At least a pool of cohesin interacts with chromatin much more stably after　DNA replication.　It requires the acetylation of two adjacent, evolutionarily conserved lysines on Smc3 by the acetyltransferase Eco1 (Esco1/2 in vertebrates), and in metazoans, the subsequent recruitment of sororin to cohesin through Pds5.
Smc3 acetylation and sororin antagonize the cohesin-releasing activity of Wapl–Pds5, thereby stabilizing cohesin on chromosomes.

- **release**:
  1. prophase: sororin is phosphorylated by mitotic kinases and dissociates from cohesin,which allows Wapl to gain access to Pds5,so cohesin is released from chromosome arms.
  2. metaphase: Sgo1-PP2A(protect centromere cohesion) redistributes from centromeres to kinetochores, leaving cohesin unprotected,then is cleaved and removed by the protease separase.

There are other cohesion function in transcription, chromatin compaction and DNA repair.

cohesinopathies: the human diseases (such as developmental defects, including growth defects, mental retardation, facial anomalies, which is caused by its altered regulating transcription function) caused by mutations in cohesin and its regulators.

Ih this review, mainly talk about the structure and function of cohesion and its regulator in mitosis, but many is same or homologs during meiosis.

### Architecture of the cohesin core complex

*[SMC1]:
SMC1 and SMC3:
- Type:ATPase(related to ABC transporter),
- Family: Smc family
- Structure :  The ATPase domain of Smc1 or Smc3 is split into two halves by a long coiled coil domain. A hinge domain is located at the middle of the coiled coil. The coiled coil folds back intramolecularly, allowing the two
ATPase halves to form a single globular ATPase head.The hinge domains of Smc1 and Smc3 mediate their heterodimerization.

SCC1:
- Family:kleisin protein family
- Structure: the three protein above form a tripartite ring, which is - asymmetric(The C-terminal of Scc1 forms a winged-helix domain (WHD) that interacts directly with the Smc1 ATPase head. And the N-terminal region of Scc1 folds into two helices, which form a four-helix bundle with the coiled-coil region adjacent to the Smc3 ATPase head)

SA1/SA2:
- Position: it associates with the central region of Scc1.
- Structure: a HEAT repeat-containing protein shaped like a dragon.
- Function: to strengthen the tripartite ring of cohesin,and as a binding platform for multiple cohesin regulators, including Wapl and Sgo1.

cohesion ring:
- DNA loading: the opening of smc1-smc3 hinge
- DNA existing: smc3-scc1
? Why DNA enters and exits cohesin through two different gates remains a mystery

### Cohesin-associated regulators

Cohesin-associated regulators ( Pds5, Wapl, Sgo1, and in metazoans, sororin )interact with cohesin transiently and often in a cell cycle-regulated manner. n, many of which interact with the Scc1–SA1/2 heterodimer in cohesin.

Pds5:
- structure: a highly conserved, large HEAT repeat-containing protein
-function:
Pds5 performs both positive (cohesion establishment)and negative functions(resolution) in sister chromatid cohesion **in multiple organisms**, possibly through recruiting both positive regulators (such as Eco1 and sororin) and negative regulators (such as Wapl) to cohesin.

Because its dual role, it still need to be clearly define the functions of Pds5 in sister chromatid cohesion.

Wapl:
- structure: C-terminal domain of Wapl consists of HEAT repeats, which form functionally important surfaces for cohesin binding,The N-terminal of Wapl appears to be flexible and provides additional interactions with both
cohesin and Pds5.
- negative function:  it  associated with cohesin through the scaffold protein Pds5, and can promote cohesion release from chromosome arms, presumably through opening the DNA exit gate,so that spares cohesin from further cleavage by separase, and preserves intact cohesin for the next cell cycle.

Sororin:
positive function: During DNA replication, sororin is recruited to cohesin through Pds5 in a process that requires Smc3 acetylation, and antagonizes the function of Wapl to stabilize cohesin.

Sororin is only found in metazoans,not in yeast. And the N terminal (binding Pds5) flexible region of Wapl proteins in metazoans is much longer than that in yeast. It is possible that sororin competes with metazoan-specific N-terminal elements of Wapl for binding to Pds5. The co-emergence of sororin and the longer Nterminal region of Wapl during evolution might offer an additional layer of regulation in sister chromatid cohesion in higher eukaryotes.

###cohesion loading onto DNA

Loading time:after chromosome segregation and prior to DNA replication.
Cohesion loading complex Scc2–Scc4:
structure: Scc2 has an unstructured N-terminal region and a C-terminal domain consisting of HEAT repeats. And the TPR repeats of Scc4 adopts a barrel shape and encapsulates the N-terminal region of Scc2 inside the barrel, thus protecting this flexible region of Scc2.
condition: the loading needs ATP hydrolysis,so Scc2 stimulates the ATPase activity of Smc1–Smc3, so this hinge is open.
? The ATPase heads of Smc1 and Smc3 are located at the opposite end. how ATP hydrolysis at one end of the ring opens the hinge region at the other end is still confused.

how Scc2–Scc4 complex ensures that cohesin is loaded at the proper chromosomal location:
eg: in mammalian cells, Scc2 can form a complex with cohesin and the mediator complex to load cohesin at gene promoter.
*[CTCF]:CTCF (protein )recognizes DNA sequences containing
CCCTC repeats with its zinc finger domains, and plays important roles in the regulation of chromatin architecture and gene transcription.CTCF has been proposed to cooperate with cohesin to induce the formation of chromatin
loops, thus separating enhancers from promoters of genes.*

Cohesin rings are not staying at sites where they are originally loaded,but ultimately positioned to sites of convergent transcription in yeast and at CCCTC-binding factor sites in mammalian cells.
As for the accumulation of CTCF, is not required for sister chromatid cohesion, but has a specific role in transcription by a direct interaction between CTCF and the cohesin SA1/2.

? How cohesin is translocated from the original Scc2–Scc4 loading sites to CTCF sites.
Answer: Transcriptional machinery actively pushes cohesin rings along chromosomes until cohesin encounters CTCF.
