supplement:
The RNAi pathway is found in many eukaryotes, including animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~21 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.

1. when...,add Thymidine(在冰箱呆久了会析晶，可以用热水煮化再使用,add 20ul(1:100,eg: for 6 well,the total volume of plate is 2ml,so add 20ul)),now cell is in G1 phase
2. 18h（this is the longest time for arrest)
3. release,empty the medium,wash it twice using PBS,and back fresh medium
4. S:2-6h
   G2:7-8h
   M:9-10h
note:
1. avoid excessive medium: short release use less medium,because cell will condition the media,using more time.
2.must spread out: or influence synchrony
